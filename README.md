# FlowCon <br>
Machine learning resource management using standalone Docker containers.

## Usage
The workflow for using FlowCon is centered on **experiments** which are composed of individual **trials** all sharing a common
 **joblist**. 

A **joblist** is simply a list of machine learning jobs meant to simulate a ML cluster environment. They are specified to start at different 
times (offset from zero by an integer number of seconds) and are generated by `make_joblist.py`. 

The aim of an **experiment** is to test the performance of the FlowCon algorithm with different parameter settings while using the same **joblist**. 

A run with a specific set of parameters is called a **trial**. 

So the workflow for using FlowCon is the following: 
  * Generate a **joblist** with `make_joblist.py` (with desired settings)
  * Based on this joblist, run numerous **trials** on CloudLab or Chameleon with various parameter settings (including control trials)
  using `run_trial.py` 
    * Syntax to run a trial is generally: 
        ```
        usage: run_trial.py [-h] [-i INTERVAL] [-a ALPHA]
                        [--docker_stats_interval DOCKER_STATS_INTERVAL]
                        [--no_update | --no_algo]
                        joblist
        ```
    * For control trials, there are two options to choose from: `--no_algo` and `--no_update`, which run the trial with no algorithm and with the algorithm but without making update to container resource limits, respectively. 
  * Collect and analyze data to evaluate the performance of the algorithm

Numerous experiments should be run to test the algorithm under different conditions.
